## Welcome!

Hello, I'm Daniele Gregori, a recent graduate holding a Master's degree in Cybersecurity. I have a profound passion for the technical challenges and problem-solving inherent in offensive security.

This repository serves as a curated collection of my hands-on projects, penetration test reports, and technical write-ups. Each project is a deep dive into a specific scenario, designed to showcase my practical skills in vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and ethical hacking.

My methodology is rooted in a structured, professional approach, ensuring that every finding is thoroughly documented and every recommendation is actionableâ€”just as it would be in a real-world engagement.
